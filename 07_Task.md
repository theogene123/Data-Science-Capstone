The goal of this exercise is to "pitch" your data product to your boss or an investor. The slide deck is constrained to be 5 slides or less and should: (1) explain how your model works, (2) describe its predictive performance quantitatively and (3) show off the app and how it works.

*Tasks to accomplish*

1.  Create a slide deck promoting your product. Write 5 slides using RStudio Presenter explaining your product and why it is awesome!

*Questions to consider*

1.  How can you briefly explain how your predictive model works?
2.  How can you succinctly quantitatively summarize the performance of your prediction algorithm?
3.  How can you show the user how the product works?

*Tips, tricks, and hints*

1.  The Rstudio presentation information is available here (<https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations>).
