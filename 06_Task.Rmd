The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others via a Shiny app..

_Tasks to accomplish_

Create a data product to show off your prediction algorithm You should create a Shiny app that accepts an n-gram and predicts the next word.  

_Questions to consider_

1. What are the most interesting ways you could show off your algorithm?
2. Are there any data visualizations you think might be helpful (look at the Swiftkey data dashboard if you have it loaded on your phone)?
3. How should you document the use of your data product (separately from how you created it) so that others can rapidly deploy your algorithm?

_Tips, tricks, and hints_

Consider the size of the predictive model you have developed. You may have to sacrifice some accuracy to have a fast enough/small enough model to load into Shiny.
